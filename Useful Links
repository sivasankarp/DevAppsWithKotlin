Lifecycle Cheat sheets
What you’ve seen up to this point are the Activity Lifecycle and the Fragment Lifecycle for a single Activity or Fragment. 
For more complicated apps, it becomes important to understand the interactions between Activity and Fragment life cycles and

cheat sheets posted by Googler which are helpful references for this:
